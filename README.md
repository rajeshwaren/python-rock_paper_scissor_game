wow you are here! i did not expect that comming
well I try to explain my code in short and sweet

# computer selection part
In my code i imported the random module and used the choice() to pick a random option from the list for the computer

# user part
i used an input function to get a numer in the range 1 to 3 
then i used the int() to covert the string into a integer
since index value of a list  eginns from 0 i subtractes 1 from the user input
and the fetch the user's desired choice

#  comparing user's choice and computer's choice
i used nested if else statements to compare
==>I described only the winning outcomes for the user and draw outcome then i use an else statement for all the other outcomes
then I used a while loop to repeat the the code whilie recursion the ponts scored will get updated
